== PROJECT: Fashion Match

---

== Overview

Fashion Match is a desktop wardrobe management application used as a guide for your fashion necessities. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 19.7 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to make available and unavailable certain apparel, or the ability to wash and dirty certain apparel*, where available and wash keywords can be used interchangebly like unavailable and dirty.
** What it does: allows the user to change an apparel's availability status, whether it should be dirty or clean.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it similates the wardrobe's laundry basket; if available, it is clean and has not been worn; if unavailable, it similates a dirty apparel in the laundry basket.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands like the recommendation class of commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of the n-level design architecture in ab4. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands, and is modelled after the EditCommand.java class.
** Credits: _none_, as i simply had to model the AvailableCommand.java and UnavailableCommand.java classes after EditCommand.java class

* *Minor enhancement*: Enabled alternative, more intuitive command words to be used in place of available and unavailable: *wash* and *dirty*.
