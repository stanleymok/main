== PROJECT: Fashion Match

---

== Overview

Fashion Match is a desktop wardrobe management application used as a guide for your fashion necessities. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 19.7 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to make wash and wear certain apparels*.
** What it does: allows the user to indicate whether an apparel's is clean or worn.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it similates the wardrobe and the laundry basket; if clean, it is hanging clean and has not been worn; if worn, it has been put in the laundry basket.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands like the recommendation class of commands and the statistics commands. It required an in-depth analysis of the n-level design architecture in ab4. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands, and is modelled after the EditCommand.java class.
** Credits: _none_, as i simply had to model the WashCommand.java and WearCommand.java classes after EditCommand.java class

* *Minor enhancement*: Learnt CSS and HTML for CS2103 to take charge of the UI Design aspect. Raffles did the back-end code, i was in charge of user experience. I did the front end, adjusting the fonts and the anchorpane settings, and choosing the right colours finding the right hexcode values for our app.
** Used photoshop skills to remove background white image from jpg image. Resized images. Did this for all 64 of tops, bottoms, belts, and shoes images in the our resources/images folder. Tedious work but worth it.
** Commissioned my artist friend to do the default image seen when Fashion Match first loads up. Titled firstpage.png in resources/image folder.
